How to Recreate This Laravel Repository
--------------------------------------------

To recreate this Laravel repository, you can follow these general steps:

 1. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using Composer. Make sure you have Composer installed on your machine.

    ```bash

    cd ski_races
    composer install

    ```

    -   **Configuration:** Laravel requires certain configuration settings to work correctly. Ensure you have a `.env` file in the project directory that contains the necessary environment variables.
    -   If the repository doesn't include an `.env` file, look for a `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`, then update the values accordingly.
    -   replace this inside the .env under DB_CONNECTION

    ```bash

    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=ski_races
    DB_USERNAME=root
    DB_PASSWORD=

    ```

    -   **Generate Application Key:** Laravel requires an application key for encryption and other security purposes. Generate a new key by running the following command:

    ```bash

    php artisan key:generate

    ```
    -   **Database Setup:** If the project uses a database, create a new database and update the `.env` file with the database credentials (DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD). Then run the              migrations to set up the database tables.

    ```bash

    php artisan migrate
    npm install
    npm run dev

    ```

    -   **Run the Application:** Start the Laravel development server to run the application locally.

    ```bash

    php artisan serve

    ```

    This will start the development server, and you can access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8000` (or a different port if specified).

By following these steps, you should be able to recreate the Laravel repository on your local machine. Note that some repositories may have additional requirements or custom configurations, so you may need to consult the repository's documentation or README file for specific instructions.
